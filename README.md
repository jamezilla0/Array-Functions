# Array-Functions
A couple of array functions that I persornaly use when enumerating over array data. Much nicer then taking up sql resource. I use it with preloaded data, when I need to effect angular an angular scope.

Constructing
$array = new arrayFnc();

Ussage

//Search
$array->search($against,$key,$val);

$against = array you will search agaisnt.
$key = which array key should we target.
$val = what the value of the key should be.
